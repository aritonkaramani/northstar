      Northstar has been around in a semi-hardcore manner since the burning
      crusade days with various realm rankings over the years. Entering legion a
      couple of old Northstar players and some others decided to tone it down a
      bit and not raid as often anymore. However, most people might relate
      casual raiding or three day raiding as non-progress aimed timewaste;
      instead, we're looking to push content as much as we did before with full
      focus at the times we raid while having a big banter doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer you an international raiding community with progress hungry
      people who enjoy the raiding phenomena just as much as you do with a
      “casual” yet focused approach of only three raid days a week on
      Wednesdays, Sundays and Mondays from 20:00-23:00 ST. On Heroic week we
      also raid Thursday and when we reach the last boss we also raid 4 times a
      week until the boss is dead. You will be able to see end bosses and
      progress in mythic modes without having to sacrifice too many other
      things, we hope this will attract some old hardcore players like some of
      us to join our ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In return we need you to be a experienced and motivated raider who knows
      your class in and out, who won't waste the little time we have with petty
      afks and silly whining. We recruit only the best players in order to make
      up for the loss of 2-3 raid days. We also want mature players who are able
      to handle progress bumps and constructive criticism without making raids
      unbearable for everybody else.

      to add any officer on battletag:
