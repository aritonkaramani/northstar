    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Northstar has been around in a semi-hardcore manner since the burning crusade days with various realm rankings
      over the
      years. Entering legion a couple of old Northstar players and some others decided to tone it down a bit and not
      raid as
      often anymore. However, most people might relate casual raiding or three day raiding as non-progress aimed
      timewaste;
      instead, we’re looking to push content as much as we did before with full focus at the times we raid while having
      a big
      banter doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer you an international raiding community with progress hungry people with a “casual” yet focused approach
      of only four raid days a week. You will be able to see end bosses and progress in early mythic without having to
      sacrifice too many other things, we hope this will attract some old hardcore players like some of us to join our
      ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In return we expect you to be experienced, or very cracked at the game, and motivated to progress raid. Know your
      class
      in and out. You're expected to prep and research (typically provided by the guild) and not come into a progress
      boss
      clueless. We also want mature players who are able to communicate their mistakes and/or confusion, take
      constructive
      criticism without getting tilted and/or it negatively impacting their play.
