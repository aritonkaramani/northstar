    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Northstar has been around in a semi-hardcore manner since the burning
      crusade days with various realm rankings over the years. Entering legion a
      couple of old Northstar players and some others decided to tone it down a
      bit and not raid as often anymore. However, most people might relate
      casual raiding or three day raiding as non-progress aimed timewaste;
      instead, we’re looking to push content as much as we did before with full
      focus at the times we raid while having a big banter doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer you an international raiding community with progress hungry
      people with a “casual” yet focused approach of only four raid days a week.
      You will be able to see end bosses and progress in early mythic without
      having to sacrifice too many other things, we hope this will attract some
      old hardcore players like some of us to join our ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In return we expect you to be experienced, or very cracked at the game,
      and motivated to progress raid. Know your class in and out. You're
      expected to prep and research (typically provided by the guild) and not
      come into a progress boss clueless. We also want mature players who are
      able to communicate their mistakes and/or confusion, take constructive
      criticism without getting tilted and/or it negatively impacting their
      play.
